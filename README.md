# Cloud Computing - COIL

These pages are also available as als [interaktive course](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://github.com/aheil/c2c2) .

**About the course**

This course page is part of the COIL Course Cloud Computing of the master course [Software Engineering Master (SEM)](https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/en/sem) at the [University of Applied Sciences in Heilbronn](https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/en) in Heilbronn, Germany, as well as the [Business Information Systems (BIS)](https://vgu.edu.vn/study-programs/master/bis) of the [Vietnamese Germany University](https://vgu.edu.vn/) in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam as part of the [COIL and Virtual Exchange program](https://www.hs-heilbronn.de/en/coil-and-virtual-exchange-40524c66c91530b5) at Heilbronn University of Applied Sciences. 

The goal is to develop a solution that is as holistic as possible. This includes the practical construction of a physical single-board computer cluster, which will be set up and put into operation as part of a joint exchange of students.

After this joint prelude, the students switch to collaborative online mode and design and install the software landscape for the administration, monitoring and operation of the built cloud platform, on which software developed by the course participants themselves is operated at the end of the project. The intercultural and geographically distributed environment will prepare the students for a real project environment.

This course page provides all companion material and results of the course.
